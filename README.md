# Deadeye
Nationstates Influence Monitor!

Running:

Windows:

In your Deadeye folder, you should find an executable. Run that, and you're more or less ready to go!

Linux/Mac:

Open up your command line/terminal, navigate to the Source folder, and type in the following:

python Deadeye.py

Usage:

Upon opening Deadeye, you should be faced with text boxes labelled Username and Target Nation, respectively.
The first is self-explanatory. Type it in, press Okay, and you're good to go.
For the second, type in the nation who's influence you want to monitor, and press Set. After a short delay, a 'Waiting' prompt should show up. This indicates that Deadeye is functioning properly, and currently monitoring the nation. If the nation's influence changes, the waiting prompt will be replaced with a 'GO!'

Note: Due to its nature, Deadeye makes a significant number of API pulls from Nationstates while running. As of such, please don't try running any API-intensive programs in conjunction with Deadeye; you'll likely hit the rate limit, and that's a bad thing. >.<
